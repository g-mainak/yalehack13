## jquery.haircut.js

We've got plenty of long filenames in the LayerVault file dashboard. We needed
a way to condense them to fit into the interface while still displaying important
parts (like the file extension). Thus, Haircut was born.

Haircut will ellipsize a string of text to fit inside of its parent container without
overflowing or breaking to another line.

You can see a video of it in action here: [Haircut in Action](https://vimeo.com/user7743505/review/46901981/e833d7d78d).

When hovering over a piece of text that's been given a haircut, the full text is display in a nice bubble. This
bubble can be styled to the user's desire. Haircut is smart enough to pull out and include anchor tags contained
within ellipsized text.

## Setup

First, include haircut on the page. Bonus points for rolling it into your asset pipeline.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery.haircut.js"></script>
```

Next, select the items on the page you want to haircut.

```javascript
$(function () {
  $('.Filename').haircut();
});
```

Next, you will need to call the method `stringResize` whenever your layout changes. This
has been abstracted out for now so that users can use things like the Underscore [throttle](http://underscorejs.org/#throttle)
and [debounce](http://underscorejs.org/#debounce) methods. It's highly recommended that you use these if you've got a heavy page.

```javascript
$(window).resize(function () {
  $('.Filename').stringResize();
});
```

## Configuration

Haircut has a few configuration parameters that will help with tweaking performance and deciding
which part of the string get ellipsized. Set the options like so:

```javascript
  $('.Filename').haircut({
    // The more haircut items on the page, the more it jitters during animation.
    // Adding padding reduces jitter but gives you less usable space.
    jitterPadding     : 30,

    // The placement of the ellipsis. Can be "beginning", "middle" or "end"
    // Defaults to "middle"
    placement         : "middle"
  });
```

## Styling

To change the styling of the hover bubble, you will need to provide stylings for the classes
`._LVshowHaircutExpand` and `._LVhaircutExpand`. You can see example CSS rules on the [test page
of this project](https://github.com/layervault/jquery.haircut.js/blob/master/index.html).
